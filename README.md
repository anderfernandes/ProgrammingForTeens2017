Make sure you create a package and a class for each solution.

1. Write a program that displays the sum of all integers between 1 and 9.

2. Write a program that reads an integer between 0 and 1000 and adds all the digits in the integer. For example, if an integer is 932, the sum of all its digits is 14. Hint: Use the % operator to extract digits, and use the / operator to remove the extracted digit. For instance, 932 % 10 = 2 and 932 / 10 = 93.

3. Write a program that checks if a number is even or odd.
